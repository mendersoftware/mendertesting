This directory has been created to contain common CI templates
shared across multiple CI jobs in multiple repos.

Those templates can be self contained or use helper scripts located
in the `utils` directory.

## retry-network-go-common.yml

Provides the `.requires-network-go-common` anchor: a before_script
snippet that verifies Go network access is available. It retries up
to 4 times before exiting with code 192 (network unavailable), which
can then be used to trigger a GitLab job retry.

**Usage in an upstream pipeline:**

```yaml
include:
  - project: Northern.tech/Mender/mendertesting
    file: qa-common/retry-network-go-common.yml

my-job:
  image: golang:1.24
  before_script:
    - !reference [.requires-network-go-common, before_script]
  retry:
    max: 2
    exit_codes:
      - 192
    when:
      - runner_system_failure
      - stuck_or_timeout_failure
  script:
    - go build ./...
```
